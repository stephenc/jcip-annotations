Introduction
------------

This is a cleanroom implementation of the [JCIP][1] Annotations.

I used only the Javadoc of the [JCIP][1] annotations.

At no time did I look at the original Findbugs source code.

Rational
--------

The JCIP Annotations are really useful, however they are released
under the [Creative Commons Attribution License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5), which is 
[not recommended for licensing software](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FAQ#Can_I_use_a_Creative_Commons_license_for_software.3F) 
and may therefore cause issues for some people.

Brian Goetz and Tim Peierls you guys are f*cking awesome, and I didn't 
realize how bad a Java developer I was until I saw that book. As soon as
I saw the Yuk face listing on page 32, I *knew* I had to buy the book. 

If there is *one* book every Java developer should have, [JCIP][1] is **that** book.
